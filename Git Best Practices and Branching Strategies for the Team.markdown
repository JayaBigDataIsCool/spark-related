# Git Best Practices and Branching Strategies for the Team

## Purpose
This document serves as a guide for the team to use Git effectively in our development workflows. It covers practical best practices, essential Git commands, and branching strategies to ensure smooth collaboration, clean codebases, and alignment with enterprise needs. The aim is to provide developers, architects, and technical leads with clear, actionable recommendations to manage version control consistently across projects.

## Git Best Practices
These practices are designed to help the team maintain an efficient and reliable Git workflow, tailored for enterprise development:

1. **Small, Descriptive Commits**:
   - Commit changes often, keeping each commit focused on a single task for easier tracking.
   - Write commit messages in the imperative (e.g., “Add payment processing” instead of “Added payments”) and include ticket numbers (e.g., “JIRA-101: Fix cart bug”).
   - Avoid unclear messages like “Update” or “Fix”; specify what was changed.

2. **Consistent Branch Naming**:
   - Follow a branching strategy (see below) that fits the project and stick to it.
   - Use clear branch names with prefixes: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/` (e.g., `feature/payment-processing`, `bugfix/cart-error`).
   - Delete merged branches regularly to keep the repository organized.

3. **Pull Requests and Code Reviews**:
   - Use pull requests (PRs) for all changes to protected branches; avoid direct pushes.
   - Require at least two reviewers per PR to ensure quality and catch issues early.
   - Provide PR descriptions that explain the change, testing steps, and any risks.

4. **Protect Key Branches**:
   - Restrict pushes to `main` and `develop` branches, allowing changes only via PRs.
   - Set branch protection rules to enforce passing CI/CD tests, signed commits, and multiple reviews.
   - Track changes with audit logs to meet compliance requirements (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR).

5. **Repository Cleanliness**:
   - Use `.gitignore` to exclude files like build outputs, logs, or secrets.
   - Set up Git hooks for pre-commit checks (e.g., linting, security scans).
   - Double-check commits to avoid including sensitive data like API keys.

6. **Tagging Releases**:
   - Tag releases with semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.2.0`) to mark milestones.
   - Add notes to tags (e.g., `git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Add payment processing"`).
   - Push tags to the remote repository for team visibility.

7. **Enterprise Tool Integration**:
   - Link Git with tools like Jira or Confluence to connect commits to tickets and documentation.
   - Use role-based permissions (e.g., write for developers, read for QA) to control access.
   - Scan dependencies with tools like Snyk or Dependabot to address vulnerabilities.
   - Sign commits with GPG for added security.

8. **Team Support**:
   - Schedule periodic Git training to keep everyone aligned.
   - Maintain a shared document (e.g., in Confluence or GitHub Wiki) with workflows and FAQs.
   - Establish a process for resolving complex Git issues, like merge conflicts, with support from senior team members.

## Git Command Reference
Below is a comprehensive list of Git commands for common enterprise tasks, including their purpose, syntax, and examples to ensure consistent usage.

### Repository Setup

## Branching Strategies
This section describes four common branching strategies, their workflows, and when to use them to support the team’s development and deployment needs.

### 1. Git Flow
**Overview**:
Git Flow is a structured approach for projects with scheduled releases and long-term maintenance. It uses multiple branches to separate development, releases, and hotfixes.

**Branch Structure**:
- `main`: Production-ready code, tagged with release versions.
- `develop`: Integration branch for features, representing the next release.
- `feature/*`: For new features (e.g., `feature/payment-processing`).
- `release/*`: For preparing releases (e.g., `release/v1.3.0`).
- `hotfix/*`: For urgent production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/cart-error`).
- `support/*`: For maintaining older releases (e.g., `support/1.x`).

**Workflow**:
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/payment-processing
   ```
2. Develop, commit, and merge via PR:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/payment-processing
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/payment-processing
   ```
3. Create a release branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.3.0
   ```
4. Finalize release (e.g., update version, fix bugs), then merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.3.0
   git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release 1.3.0"
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/v1.3.0
   ```
5. For hotfixes, branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/cart-error
   ```
6. Merge hotfix into `main` and `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/cart-error
   git tag -a v1.3.1 -m "Hotfix 1.3.1"
   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/cart-error
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Separates development, staging, and production code clearly.
- Supports maintaining multiple versions for long-term projects.
- Fits well with compliance-driven release processes.

**Challenges**:
- Managing multiple branches can be complex.
- May slow down teams with frequent releases.

### 2. GitHub Flow
**Overview**:
GitHub Flow is a simple, continuous delivery model that uses a single `main` branch and short-lived feature branches for fast-paced development.

**Branch Structure**:
- `main`: Always production-ready and deployable.
- `<type>/*`: Short-lived branches (e.g., `feature/payment-processing`, `bugfix/cart`).

**Workflow**:
1. Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b feature/payment-processing
   ```
2. Develop and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "JIRA-101: Add payment processing"
   git push origin feature/payment-processing
   ```
3. Open a PR, ensure CI/CD checks pass, and get reviews.
4. Merge into `main` and deploy:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/payment-processing
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Delete the branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/payment-processing
   git push origin --delete feature/payment-processing
   ```

**Benefits**:
- Straightforward and fast for frequent deployments.
- Encourages team collaboration through PRs.
- Minimal branch management.

**Challenges**:
- Less suited for projects with long release cycles or multiple versions.
- Relies on strong automated testing to keep `main` stable.

### 3. GitLab Flow
**Overview**:
GitLab Flow combines continuous delivery with support for versioned releases, offering flexibility for projects with mixed needs.

**Branch Structure**:
- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `feature/*`: For development work.
- `pre-release/*`: For preparing releases (e.g., `pre-release/v1.3`).
- `stable-<version>`: For maintaining releases (e.g., `stable-1.3`).

**Workflow**:
1. For continuous delivery, follow GitHub Flow.
2. For releases, create a pre-release branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b pre-release/v1.3
   ```
3. Finalize and merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge pre-release/v1.3
   git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release 1.3.0"
   ```
4. Optionally, create a stable branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b stable-1.3
   ```
5. Apply hotfixes to `stable-1.3` or `main` as needed.

**Benefits**:
- Flexible for both frequent and versioned releases.
- Supports stable branches for specific clients or versions.
- Adapts to different team workflows.

**Challenges**:
- Multiple stable branches can add complexity.
- Needs clear team agreement on conventions.

### 4. Trunk-Based Development
**Overview**:
Trunk-Based Development uses a single `main` branch with minimal branching, relying on automated testing and feature flags for stability.

**Branch Structure**:
- `main`: The only long-lived, deployable branch.
- `<feature|bugfix>/*`: Optional, short-lived branches.

**Workflow**:
1. Create a short-lived branch (optional):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b feature/payment-processing
   ```
2. Commit frequently:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "JIRA-101: Add payment endpoint"
   ```
3. Merge quickly to `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/payment-processing
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Run automated tests and deploy.
5. Use feature flags for incomplete features.

**Benefits**:
- Reduces merge conflicts and branch overhead.
- Aligns with DevOps and CI/CD practices.
- Encourages small, incremental changes.

**Challenges**:
- Requires robust CI/CD and testing setups.
- Not ideal for long development cycles or strict release schedules.

## Recommended Branching Strategies for Teams
The best branching strategy depends on the team’s size, project type, and release cadence. Here are tailored recommendations for common team scenarios:
