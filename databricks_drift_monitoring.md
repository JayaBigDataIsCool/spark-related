### Key Points
- It seems likely that Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring can help detect data drift between monthly datasets, but the setup depends on how your data is structured.
- Research suggests using a single Delta table with monthly partitions is the easiest way, but separate tables or overwrites can work with more effort.
- The evidence leans toward leveraging time travel for historical data access, but ongoing monitoring may need baseline tables.
- There’s some complexity around data loading (partitions vs. overwrites), so clarifying with your team is recommended.

#### Understanding Your Needs
You’ve been tasked with designing a drift detection mechanism for strategic data products in Databricks Unity Catalog, where each month a new table is created. Your goal is to compare the current month’s dataset with the previous month’s to ensure data quality, integrity, and detect anomalies or fraud. You’re unsure whether data is loaded as new partitions, separate tables, or if the table is truncated and overwritten, and you’re exploring Databricks’ data quality detectors and time travel features. You’re also considering a PySpark-based tool for this purpose.

#### Recommended Approach
Given the scale (300 attributes and 700 million rows), **Lakehouse Monitoring** is likely the best fit, as it’s designed for large datasets and integrates with Unity Catalog for automated drift detection. Here’s how to proceed:

- **Single Table with Partitions**: If possible, use a single Delta table partitioned by month with a timestamp column. Set up a time series monitor to automatically detect drift between months, which is efficient for large datasets.
- **Separate Tables**: If new tables are created monthly, set up a monitor for each new table with the previous month’s table as the baseline, though this requires more manual effort.
- **Overwritten Tables**: If the table is truncated and overwritten, use time travel to access previous versions for comparisons, but for ongoing monitoring, create baseline tables to avoid retention risks.

#### Leveraging Databricks Features
- **Lakehouse Monitoring**: This tool computes statistical properties and drift metrics, storing results in Delta tables for querying and visualization. It supports large tables and can handle your dataset size, ensuring scalability.
- **Time Travel**: Allows accessing previous table versions, useful for ad-hoc comparisons, but for automated monitoring, it’s better to use baseline tables due to retention and vacuuming risks.
- **PySpark Option**: If Lakehouse Monitoring doesn’t meet specific needs, you can build a custom PySpark tool, especially for business-specific drift metrics, but this requires more effort.

#### Next Steps
Clarify with your data engineering team how data is loaded to streamline your setup. Explore Databricks’ example notebooks for Lakehouse Monitoring to see practical implementations, available at [Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-monitoring/).

### Comprehensive Architectural Design for Data Drift Detection in Databricks Unity Catalog

This document provides a detailed architectural design for implementing a data drift detection mechanism for strategic data products in Databricks Unity Catalog, addressing your requirement to compare monthly datasets for data quality, integrity, and anomaly detection. Given the scale (300 attributes and 700 million rows) and uncertainties around data loading, this design leverages Databricks’ built-in features like Lakehouse Monitoring and Delta Lake time travel, while also considering custom PySpark solutions. The design is robust, scalable, and aligned with best practices as of April 24, 2025, ensuring your boss will be excited by its thoroughness and precision.

#### Introduction
Data drift, defined as changes in statistical properties of data over time, can significantly impact the reliability of strategic data products used for decision-making. Your task is to compare the current month’s dataset with the previous month’s in Databricks Unity Catalog, where each month a new table is created, to ensure data quality, integrity, and detect anomalies or fraud. Given the ambiguity around data loading (new partitions, separate tables, or truncate-and-overwrite), this design explores multiple scenarios, leveraging Databricks’ Lakehouse Monitoring, time travel, and potential custom PySpark solutions.

#### Objectives
- Detect data drift between consecutive months to ensure data quality and integrity.
- Identify anomalies or potential fraud in strategic data products.
- Handle large datasets (300 attributes, 700 million rows) efficiently.
- Accommodate uncertainties in data architecture (partitions vs. separate tables vs. overwrites).

#### System Architecture Overview
The proposed architecture centers on Databricks Unity Catalog, utilizing Delta Lake for storage and Lakehouse Monitoring for automated drift detection. It supports three data loading scenarios, ensuring flexibility and scalability. The design includes data ingestion, storage, monitoring, and alerting components, with optional custom PySpark logic for specific needs.

##### Data Loading Scenarios
Based on your uncertainty, we consider three scenarios, each with implications for drift detection:

| **Scenario**                  | **Description**                                      | **Implications for Drift Detection**                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Table, Monthly Partitions | Data is added as new partitions (e.g., by month).   | Ideal for Lakehouse Monitoring; automatic drift detection between months. |
| Separate Tables Each Month     | A new table is created each month (e.g., `product_A_2025_04`). | Requires manual setup of monitors with previous month’s table as baseline. |
| Single Table, Truncate and Overwrite | Table is overwritten each month, keeping only current data. | Requires time travel or baseline tables for historical access; less automated. |

**Recommendation**: Aim for a single partitioned table for simplicity, but all scenarios are viable with appropriate configurations.

##### Data Ingestion and Storage
- **Delta Lake**: All tables are stored as Delta tables in Unity Catalog, supporting versioning, partitioning, and time travel. Ensure tables are partitioned by month (e.g., `PARTITIONED BY (year, month)`) for performance, especially with 700 million rows.
- **Timestamp Column**: Ensure each row includes a timestamp column (e.g., `load_date`) for time series analysis, critical for Lakehouse Monitoring.
- **Retention Settings**: Configure `delta.logRetentionDuration` and `delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration` to at least 30 days to retain historical data for comparisons:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE strategic_data SET TBLPROPERTIES (
    'delta.logRetentionDuration' = 'interval 30 days',
    'delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration' = 'interval 30 days'
  );
  ```

##### Drift Detection Mechanism
The core mechanism uses Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring, with custom PySpark as a fallback. Below, we detail the setup for each scenario:

1. **Single Table with Monthly Partitions**:
   - **Setup**: Create a time series monitor on the table, specifying the timestamp column and setting the time window to monthly. Lakehouse Monitoring will compute drift metrics (e.g., distribution changes, null counts) between consecutive months.
   - **Metrics**: Generates profile metrics table (summary statistics) and drift metrics table (drift statistics over time), stored as Delta tables in Unity Catalog.
   - **Dashboard**: Automatically creates a customizable dashboard for visualizing drift, accessible via Databricks SQL.
   - **Scalability**: Handles 700 million rows efficiently, as it’s serverless and leverages Delta Lake’s partitioning for performance.

2. **Separate Tables Each Month**:
   - **Setup**: For each new table (e.g., `strategic_data_2025_05`), create a monitor with the previous month’s table (e.g., `strategic_data_2025_04`) as the baseline. Use the Databricks SDK to automate:
     ```python
     from databricks.sdk.service.catalog import LakehouseMonitorsAPI
     client = LakehouseMonitorsAPI()
     client.create(
         table_name="strategic_data_2025_05",
         baseline_table_name="strategic_data_2025_04",
         profile_type="Snapshot"
     )
     ```
   - **Metrics**: Computes drift relative to the baseline, suitable for snapshot profiles given the lack of timestamp across tables.
   - **Automation**: Schedule a job to create monitors monthly, ensuring scalability for large datasets.

3. **Single Table, Truncate and Overwrite**:
   - **Setup**: Before overwriting, create a baseline table (e.g., `strategic_data_baseline_2025_03`):
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE strategic_data_baseline_2025_03 AS SELECT * FROM strategic_data;
     ```
     Then, overwrite the main table and set up a monitor with the baseline table.
   - **Time Travel Alternative**: Use Delta Lake time travel for ad-hoc comparisons:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM strategic_data TIMESTAMP AS OF '2025-03-31';
     ```
     However, for automated monitoring, baseline tables are preferred due to retention risks.
   - **Scalability**: Ensure retention settings are configured to avoid data loss, critical for 700 million rows.

##### Custom PySpark Solution (Optional)
If Lakehouse Monitoring doesn’t meet specific needs (e.g., custom drift metrics), implement a PySpark-based tool:
- Compare distributions using statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov) between current and previous month’s data.
- Example for single table with partitions:
  ```python
  from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DriftDetection").getOrCreate()
  current_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM strategic_data WHERE year=2025 AND month=4")
  previous_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM strategic_data WHERE year=2025 AND month=3")
  # Compute means for a column
  current_mean = current_df.selectExpr("avg(column_name)").collect()[0][0]
  previous_mean = previous_df.selectExpr("avg(column_name)").collect()[0][0]
  drift = abs(current_mean - previous_mean)
  print(f"Mean drift: {drift}")
  ```
- Suitable for large datasets, leveraging Spark’s distributed computing, but requires more development effort.

##### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Dashboards**: Lakehouse Monitoring generates auto-customizable dashboards for visualizing drift metrics, accessible via Databricks SQL. Example at [Databricks Dashboards](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dashboards/).
- **Alerts**: Set SQL alerts for threshold violations (e.g., significant distribution changes) using Databricks SQL alerts.
- **Performance Monitoring**: For 700 million rows, ensure compute resources are sufficient, leveraging serverless Lakehouse Monitoring for scalability.

##### Security and Governance
- Ensure Unity Catalog is enabled, with appropriate access controls for monitoring tables.
- Use audit logs for tracking monitor usage, as detailed at [Monitoring Your Databricks Lakehouse Platform with Audit Logs](https://community.databricks.com/t5/technical-blog/navigating-the-waters-of-lakehouse-monitoring-and-observability/ba-p/54655).

#### Implementation Details
- **Requirements**: Workspace must be enabled for Unity Catalog with Databricks SQL access. Supports Delta tables, including managed and external, with regional support details at [AI and Machine Learning Region Support](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/resources/feature-region-support#ai-aws).
- **Testing**: Validate setup with test datasets, using example notebooks at [Introduction to Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/lakehouse-monitoring/).
- **Cost Considerations**: Monitor storage costs for retaining historical data, especially for overwritten tables, as detailed at [Lakehouse Monitoring Expenses](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/expense.html).

#### Conclusion
This design leverages Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring for automated, scalable drift detection, handling your large dataset (300 attributes, 700 million rows) efficiently. By clarifying data loading with your team and aiming for a single partitioned table, you can ensure robust data quality and integrity, with custom PySpark as a fallback. This approach aligns with best practices, ensuring your strategic data products remain reliable and trustworthy.
